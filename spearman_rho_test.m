%%%% SPEARMAN'S RHO TEST   %%%%% %%%%%%%%%%%%

function[Td,p_value]=SpearmanRho(V,alpha)
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%% Performs Spearman's rho test of the null hypothesis of trend
%%% absence in the vector V,  against the alternative of trend. 
%%% The result of the test is returned in Td = 1 indicates positive trend
%%% Td = -1 indicates negative trends, i.e., 
%%% a rejection of the null hypothesis at the alpha significance level. Td = 0 indicates
%%% a failure to reject the null hypothesis at the alpha significance level.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%% INPUTS
%V = time series [vector]
%alpha =  significance level of the test [scalar]
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%% From Matlab Help %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%The significance level of a test is a threshold of probability a agreed
%to before the test is conducted. A typical value of alpha is 0.05. If the p-value of a test is less than alpha,
%the test rejects the null hypothesis. If the p-value is greater than alpha, there is insufficient evidence 
%to reject the null hypothesis. 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%% OUTPUTS
%Td = test result: [1] Positive Trend; [-1] Negative Trend;  [0] Insufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis
%p_value = p-value of the test
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%% From Matlab Help %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%The p-value of a test is the probability, under the null hypothesis, of obtaining a value
%of the test statistic as extreme or more extreme than the value computed from
%the sample.
